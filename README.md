## 🛠️ Architecture

The Go Wallet SDK follows a modular architecture, comprising the following core components:

1. **`coins`**: Implements transaction creation and signing for each blockchain.
2. **`crypto`**: Manages general cryptographic operations and signature algorithms.
3. **`util`**: Provides helper utilities for common operations.

This structure allows for easy integration and extension of new blockchains.

## 📦 Installation

To install the OKX Web3 Go Wallet SDK, ensure you have Go 1.22+ installed, such as run:

```shell
# Install SDK
go get -u github.com/okx/go-wallet-sdk/coins/bitcoin
```

## ⚙️ Build and Test

To build and test all blockchain modules, use the `build.sh` script located in the project root. This script iterates through each chain module under the `coins` directory, runs `go mod tidy` to clean dependencies, executes tests, and verifies successful builds.

```shell
sh build.sh
```

The output will display the build status for each chain. If a module fails, the error message will indicate the issue for further debugging.
